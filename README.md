# Data Mining Final Project
This project investigates the presence and distribution of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water sources. PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used in industrial and consumer products that have been linked to environmental and health risks. Using data mining techniques, we will analyze contamination levels, identify potential sources, and explore trends across different geographic locations.

## Research Questions
Some possible research questions for this project include: 
1. Can we predict PFAS levels for future years ?
2. What states have the worst water quality/what are high risk areas?
3. How do contamination patterns vary by region
4. How do contamination levels vary by water source type? Groundwater etc.
5. Which contaminant appears the most over time?
6. How does contamination vary over time?
7. How does contamination correlate with poverty?
8. How does contamination correlate with population/density?
9. Do certain contaminants appear together?
10. Does this point us to any treatment plans for the future?
